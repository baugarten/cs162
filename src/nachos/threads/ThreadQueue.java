/**
 * Schedules access to some sort of resource with limited access constraints. A
 * thread queue can be used to share this limited access among multiple
 * threads.
 *
 * <p>
 * Examples of limited access in Nachos include:
 *
 * <ol>
 * <li>the right for a thread to use the processor. Only one thread may run on
 * the processor at a time.
 *
 * <li>the right for a thread to acquire a specific lock. A lock may be held by
 * only one thread at a time.
 *
 * <li>the right for a thread to return from <tt>Semaphore.P()</tt> when the
 * semaphore is 0. When another thread calls <tt>Semaphore.V()</tt>, only one
 * thread waiting in <tt>Semaphore.P()</tt> can be awakened.
 *
 * <li>the right for a thread to be woken while sleeping on a condition
 * variable. When another thread calls <tt>Condition.wake()</tt>, only one
 * thread sleeping on the condition variable can be awakened.
 *
 * <li>the right for a thread to return from <tt>KThread.join()</tt>. Threads
 * are not allowed to return from <tt>join()</tt> until the target thread has
 * finished.
 * </ol>
 *
 * All these cases involve limited access because, for each of them, it is not
 * necessarily possible (or correct) for all the threads to have simultaneous
 * access. Some of these cases involve concrete resources (e.g. the processor,
 * or a lock); others are more abstract (e.g. waiting on semaphores, condition
 * variables, or join).
 *
 * <p>
 * All thread queue methods must be invoked with <b>interrupts disabled</b>.

     * access. This method should only be called if the thread cannot
     * immediately obtain access (e.g. if the thread wants to acquire a lock

     *
     * <p>
     * A thread must not simultaneously wait for access to multiple resources.
     * For example, a thread waiting for a lock must not also be waiting to run
     * on the processor; if a thread is waiting for a lock it should be
     * sleeping.
     *
     * <p>
     * However, depending on the specific objects, it may be acceptable for a
     * thread to wait for access to one object while having access to another.
     * For example, a thread may attempt to acquire a lock while holding
     * another lock. Note, though, that the processor cannot be held while
     * waiting for access to anything else.
