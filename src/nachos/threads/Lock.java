 * lock:
 *
 * <ul>
 * <li><tt>acquire()</tt>: atomically wait until the lock is <i>free</i> and
 * then set it to <i>busy</i>.
 * <li><tt>release()</tt>: set the lock to be <i>free</i>, waking up one
 * waiting thread if possible.
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>
 * Also, only the thread that acquired a lock may release it. As with
 * semaphores, the API does not allow you to read the lock state (because the
 * value could change immediately after you read it).
